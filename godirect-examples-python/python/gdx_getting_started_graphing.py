'''
This example collects data from one or more Vernier GDX devices and displays and 
graphs the readings.
Note that if your computer is slow, the graph may not keep up with the data collection.
This program supports up to three sensors.
You can stop data collection with a control-c keypress.

This program uses Pyplot, which is part of MatPlotLib. Pyplot allows hundreds of options for graph style.
See https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html and https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.html?highlight=pyplot 
for information.
