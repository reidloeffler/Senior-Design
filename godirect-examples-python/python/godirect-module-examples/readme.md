# Go DirectÂ® Sensor Readout

Simple example of using the [godirect-py module](https://pypi.org/project/godirect/) to connect to a Vernier Go Direct Sensor and log some default sensor value.

[go-direct-sensor-readout](./godirect-sensor-readout.py)

## API of godirect-py

Connect to the first available USB device or closest BLE device within the default threshold and collect 10 samples from the default sensor.
```python
from godirect import GoDirect
godirect = GoDirect()
device = godirect.get_device()
if device != None and device.open(auto_start=True):
	sensors = device.get_enabled_sensors()
	print("Connected to "+device.name)
	print("Reading 10 measurements")
	for i in range(0,10):
		if device.read():
			for sensor in sensors:
				print(sensor.sensor_description+": "+str(sensor.value))
	device.stop()
	device.close()
godirect.quit()
```

Note that you can choose to enable USB, BLE, or both. By default both will be enabled.
```python
godirect = GoDirect(use_ble=True, use_usb=True)
```

Here is how to obtain a list of GoDirectDevice objects from the BLE and/or USB backends.
```python
# returns a list of GoDirectDevice objects
devices = godirect.list_devices()
```

Or you can let the library automatically find the nearest device for you.
```python
# returns a GoDirectDevice on success or None on failure
mydevice = godirect.get_device()

# to adjust the BLE threshold pass in a minimum dB value
mydevice = godirect.get_device(threshold=-200)
```

Once a device is found or selected it must be opened. By default only information will be 
gathered on Open. To automatically enable the default sensors and start measurements send 
auto_start=True and skip to getting a list of enabled sensors. 
```python
# returns True on success or False on failure
mydevice.open()
```

Once a device is opened you can obtain a list of sensor objects available on
the device.
```python
# returns a list of Sensor objects
sensors = mydevice.list_sensors()
```

Optionally you can select the sensors you want to collect from, otherwise the
default sensor(s) will be used.
```python
# pass a list of sensor numbers to enable
mydevice.enable_sensors([2,3,4])
```

```python
# start measurements at the typical rate for the enabled sensors
mydevice.start() # returns True on success

# start measurements at 1000ms per sample
mydevice.start(period=1000)

# get a list of the GoDirectSensor objects that are enabled
mysensors = mydevice.get_enabled_sensors()
```

The `read()` method will block until data is returned so it is acceptable to read
in a tight loop.

```python
for i in range(0,10):
  # read() will append the measurement received to the values list in the Sensor object
  if mydevice.read():
    for sensor in mysensors:
			print(sensor.value)
```

The `stop()` method will stop data collection on the device. The `close()` method
will disconnect the USB or BLE device. The `quit()` method will stop the USB or BLE backends gracefully.

## Debugging

godirect uses the standard python logging module. You can set the logging verbosity
to INFO or DEBUG to see more communication detail.

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger('godirect').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('bleak').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('pygatt').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```
